==========================================================================
fdkaac - command line frontend encoder for libfdk-aac
==========================================================================

Prerequisites
-------------
You need libfdk-aac.
On Posix environment, you will also need GNU gettext (for iconv.m4) and
GNU autoconf/automake.

How to build on Posix environment
---------------------------------
First, you need to build libfdk-aac and install on your system.
Once you have done it, the following will do the task.
(MinGW build can be done the same way, and doesn't require gettext/iconv)

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure && make && make install

How to build on MSVC
--------------------
First you have to extract libfdk-aac source here, so that directory tree will
look like the following:
+- fdk-aac ---+-documentation
|             +-libAACdec
|             +-libAACenc
|             :
+- m4
+- missings
+- MSVC
+- src

MSVC solution for Visual Studio 2010 is under MSVC directory.

Tagging Options
---------------
Generic tagging options like --tag, --tag-from-file, --long-tag allows you
to set arbitrary tags.
Available tags and their fcc (four char code) for --tag and --tag-from-file
can be found at http://code.google.com/p/mp4v2/wiki/iTunesMetadata

For tags such as Artist where first char of fcc is copyright sign,
you can skip first char and just say like --tag="ART:Foo Bar" or
--tag-from-file=lyr:/path/to/your/lyrics.txt
